[{"text":"Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph represented as an adjacency matrix.     Input: Adjacency matrix: [[0, 10, 0, 5], [10, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 1], [5, 0, 1, 0]], Source node: 0      Output: Shortest distances: [0, 9, 6, 5]      Passing Criteria: Correctly calculates shortest paths, handles no paths, efficient for large graphs."},{"text":"Create a simple AI for Tic-Tac-Toe using the minimax algorithm.     Input: Board state: [['X', 'O', 'X'], ['O', 'X', 'O'], ['', '', '']]      Output: Best move: (2, 0)      Passing Criteria: AI plays optimally, never loses, handles all game states correctly."},{"text":"Implement the game Snake using Pygame, including features like increasing length on eating food and game over on self-collision.     Input: User controls (arrow keys)      Output: Game window with snake and food      Passing Criteria: Correct movement, grows on eating, ends on collision."},{"text":"Develop a Minesweeper game using Pygame, including revealing tiles, flagging, and game over conditions.     Input: User clicks on cells      Output: Game board with numbers and mines      Passing Criteria: Correct mine placement, accurate hints, proper game over conditions."},{"text":"Create a Tetris game using Pygame, with different shapes, rotation, and a scoring system.
