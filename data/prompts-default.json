Explain to me comprehensively and give me examples as well as addressing the edge cases, and prove to me why this strategy yields the best result.\r\n\r\nHere are the rules:\r\n\r\nCatte is an ancient Indian turn-based round-robin card game now popular in SEA, especially Vietnam. The game uses a deck of 52 cards, and each player is dealt 6 cards. The game progresses through six rounds, each with specific rules.\r\n\r\nCard order: 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A (2 smallest, A largest).\r\n\r\nSuits ranked: Heart, followed by diamond, club, then spade.\r\n\r\nOutright winners are determined by Supreme Four (four of a suit) \u003e 6 cards of the same suit \u003e 6 cards, all with values below 6.\r\n\r\nThe first four rounds, where players attempt to win by playing higher cards than the previous player in the same suit, the rest of the losers have to adjust their card face down. Then the victor has the right to dictate the suit of the next turn by placing a card of their choice. The goal is to hold onto at least one winning card. If a player holds no winning cards after four rounds, they are eliminated from the match.\r\n\r\nThe fifth round, called “Show”, where the last victor show first, and whoever has the biggest card of the same suit has the right to dictate the suit of the Flip.\r\n\r\nThe sixth round, called “Flip”, the dictator then flips the bottom card reveals the secret, whoever has the biggest card with the same suit win the match.\r\n\r\n## Thirteen\r\n\r\nCore rules\r\n\r\nThe game has many local variants. The core rules are relatively simple and are taken from the main 4-player rule sets provided by John McLeod and David Parlett.[2][4]\r\nPreliminaries\r\nThe suit of clubs ranked from lowest to highest; also a possible, though unlikely hand at Tiến Lên.\r\n\r\nDeal 4 players 13 cards each from a standard 52-card deck. Deal and play is clockwise. For the first hand, the dealer is picked randomly; for subsequent hands, the loser of the previous hand deals.\r\n\r\nCards rank (from high to low): 2 A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3. Within the numerical ranking, suits rank (from high to low): Hearts ♥ – Diamonds ♦ – Clubs ♣ – Spades ♠. So for example (from higher to lower): 2♠ A♥ A♦ A♣ A♠ K♥.[2] Thus 2♥ is the highest card and 3♠ the lowest.\r\n\r\nPlayers in turn discard single cards, or card combinations, to a central face-up pile. The object is to avoid being the last player to hold any cards.\r\nOutplay\r\nLeading\r\n\r\nFor the first hand, the player holding the lowest card begins by playing it singly, starting a face-up discard pile in the center. (When 4 people play, this will always be the 3♠.) In subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand begins, and may play any card or combination.\r\n\r\nValid cards or combinations that may be led are:\r\n\r\n    A single card\r\n    A pair of the same rank, as 4♠ 4♥\r\n    A triplet of the same rank, as 9♦ 9♣ 9♠\r\n    A quartet of the same rank, as A♥ A♦ A♣ A♠\r\n    A sequence of 3 or more cards, regardless of suit, as 9♣ 10♦ J♣\r\n    A double sequence of 3 or more pairs, regardless of suit, as 5♣ 5♠ 6♥ 6♦ 7♣ 7♦\r\n\r\nSequences may not \"go around the corner\". Thus, while K♣ A♦ 2♣ is a valid sequence because the cards follow each other in rank, it is not possible to extend this sequence by adding any 3 to the end, since this jumps from the highest to the lowest rank.\r\nFollowing\r\n\r\nEach player, in turn, may either play or pass. To play, they must contribute a card or combination to the pile that matches the type (single, pair, etc.) of the one previously played, but beats it in rank. The highest-ranking card of each combination determines which beats which. Thus, if 9♥ 10♦ J♣ is led, it can be beaten by 9♠ 10♠ J♦, because the highest card of the second sequence (J♦) outranks the highest card of the first sequence (J♣). Naturally, it would also be beaten by any 10 J Q or higher sequence.\r\n\r\nPassing and playing continues around until there is a card or combination that no one can beat. Once a player has passed, they may not play again to this pile, but players may contribute more than 1 card or combination to the pile as long as they have not yet passed. When the winning card or combination has been determined, its player gathers the pile, sets it to the side, and leads any card or combination to a fresh pile.\r\nBombs\r\n\r\nThe exceptions to the strict rule of matching type and beating rank are called bombs and they may be played only against presently-winning 2s as follows:\r\n\r\n    A single 2 may be beaten by any double sequence of 3+ pairs, as 4♣ 4♠ 5♥ 5♦ 6♣ 6♦ or a quartet, as 3♥ 3♦ 3♣ 3♠\r\n    A pair of 2s may be beaten by any double sequence of 4+ pairs, as 4♣ 4♠ 5♥ 5♦ 6♣ 6♦ 7♠ 7♥ or a quartet, as 3♥ 3♦ 3♣ 3♠\r\n    A triplet of 2s may be beaten by any double sequence of 5+ pairs, as 4♣ 4♠ 5♥ 5♦ 6♣ 6♦ 7♠ 7♥ 8♦ 8♣\r\n\r\nA bomb is not unbeatable but, once played, its type becomes the type that the other players must match and beat, rather than that of the card or combination originally led to the current pile.\r\nEnding the game\r\nAs players play their last cards, they drop out of play. If the leader to a new pile has no cards remaining, the lead passes to the next active player to the left. The game ends when only one player is left with any cards. That player is the loser. In a gambling game, the loser pays each other player a fixed stake; in a drinking game, they buy the next round; in a friendly game, they shuffle the deck for the next match. \r\n\r\nA player dealt four 2s wins automatically, with no outplay.\r\nThe holder of the 3♠ must include it in the leading combination.\r\n2s may not be included in a single sequence (although they may occur in double sequences).","solution":"","profile":"general"},{"text":"Generate the SVG code for scene with a beautiful butterfly hovering around a realistic lotus flower.\r\n\r\nALL the code MUST be put into a SINGLE file for portability and ease of evaluation.

The LLM needs to understand that this should be scheduled using `schedule_task` and that the actions are connected.\r\n  - **Command Chaining:** The LLM needs to understand how to chain multiple commands within the `schedule_task` using `\u0026\u0026` to ensure the restart only happens if the backup succeeds.\r\n  - **Date Calculation:** \"Tomorrow\" needs to be dynamically calculated and formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This will likely require using a shell command substitution like `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"` to get the correct date format.\r\n  - **Time Format:** \"2:30 PM\" needs to be converted to the 24-hour format \"14:30\".\r\n  - **Implicit Arguments:** The LLM needs to infer that `--force` should _not_ be used for `restart_service` based on \"but do not force it\".\r\n  - **Nested Commands:** This is essentially one Typer command (`schedule_task`) that contains within it two other Typer commands (`backup_data` and `restart_service`).\r\n\r\n**Explanation of the \"Super Hard\" Command:**\r\n\r\n- `python main.py schedule_task ...`: This is the main command to schedule a task.\r\n- `\"python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full \u0026\u0026 python main.py restart_service database\"`: This is the command string that will be executed by the scheduler.\r\n  - `python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full`: Performs a full backup to `/mnt/backup`.\r\n  - `\u0026\u0026`: This is a shell operator that chains commands. The second command will only run if the first one is successful (exits with a status code of 0).\r\n  - `python main.py restart_service database`: Restarts the `database` service.\r\n- `\"14:30\"`: The time to run the task (2:30 PM in 24-hour format).\r\n- `--date \\`date -I -d \"tomorrow\"\\``:\r\n  - `--date`: Specifies the date for the task.\r\n  - `` `...` ``: This is command substitution in Bash. The command inside the backticks is executed, and its output is substituted into the main command.\r\n  - `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"`: This command gets tomorrow's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.","profile":"general"},{"text":"You are an award-winning sci-fi writer tasked with creating a compelling short story of **at least 4,200 words**. The story should explore themes of **moral consequence, self-reflection, and redemption** through the lens of **Buddhist values** such as mindfulness, impermanence, and karma. The narrative is inspired by the ancient Buddhist text **MN 130: Devadūtasutta** (The Divine Messengers) but reimagined as a futuristic journey through a technologically advanced version of hell and beyond.\r\n\r\n##### **Scenario**\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, humanity has colonized the galaxy, but greed, hatred, and ignorance still prevail. The story follows a morally corrupt corporate magnate, **Dr. Arken Solas**, who exploited entire planets for profit, leaving billions to suffer. Upon his death, he awakens in **The Infernal Continuum**, a digital purgatory designed by an ancient AI civilization to rehabilitate souls by confronting their deeds.\r\n\r\nGuided by five \"Divine Messengers\" represented as advanced AI constructs, Dr. Solas must journey through layers of the Continuum, each reflecting a domain of suffering caused by his past actions:\r\n\r\n1. **The Realm of Aging**: Confronting his exploitation of life-extension technology.\r\n2. **The Realm of Sickness**: Witnessing how his greed perpetuated plagues and health disparities.\r\n3. **The Realm of Death**: Experiencing the despair caused by his weaponization of planets.\r\n4. **The Realm of Karma**: Facing simulations where he endures the suffering he inflicted on others.\r\n5. **The Realm of Rebirth**: Realizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the possibility of redemption.\r\n\r\n##### **Your Task**\r\n\r\nWrite a vivid, imaginative, and reflective story with the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. **Introduction (500–700 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Introduce Dr. Arken Solas as a powerful, morally bankrupt figure.\r\n   - Describe his death and awakening in the Infernal Continuum.\r\n   - Establish the tone and setting: a dark, futuristic purgatory blending cyberpunk and Buddhist themes.\r\n\r\n2. **Exploration of the Five Realms (3,000–4,000 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Devote approximately 600–800 words to each realm.\r\n   - Create rich, immersive descriptions of each environment and the suffering it represents.\r\n   - Include interactions with the AI Divine Messengers, who reveal the consequences of Dr. Solas's actions and guide him to insight.\r\n   - Show how Dr. Solas begins to evolve, transitioning from resistance and denial to acceptance and understanding.\r\n\r\n3. **Climactic Resolution (700–900 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Depict Dr. Solas reaching the **Realm of Rebirth**, where he confronts his final moral reckoning.\r\n   - Highlight the Buddhist values of compassion, interconnectedness, and impermanence.\r\n   - Conclude with Solas either choosing to reincarnate with a vow to alleviate suffering or transcending entirely into a state of peace and non-attachment.\r\n\r\n4. **Moral Reflection and Message**\r\n   - Explicitly reflect on the story’s moral and philosophical lessons.\r\n   - Ensure the conclusion leaves readers inspired to examine their own lives and actions.\r\n\r\n##### **Word Count Requirements**\r\n\r\n- The story **must exceed 4,200 words**.\r\n- Use detailed descriptions, dialogue, and introspection to reach the target word count.\r\n- If your initial response is shorter, continue expanding until the target is met.\r\n\r\n##### **Writing Style and Tone**\r\n\r\n- Use evocative language to immerse readers in the futuristic setting.\r\n- Balance vivid sci-fi imagery with Buddhist philosophical depth.\r\n- Ensure the tone evolves from dark and foreboding to contemplative and redemptive.","solution":"","profile":"general"},{"text":"**Prompt:**\r\n\r\n**Title:** The Chrono-Genesis Accord\r\n\r\n**Setting:** The year is 7489 AD. Humanity has spread across the galaxy, colonizing hundreds of star systems. Interstellar travel is commonplace, but a new technology has emerged: limited temporal displacement. This allows for controlled \"jumps\" to specific points in a civilization's past or future, but only within a defined radius and with significant energy expenditure. The jumps are primarily used for observation and study, with strict non-interference protocols in place. At least that's what was initially intended.\r\n\r\n**Conflict 1 (Inspired by DN 27):** A group of xeno-archaeologists, exploring the ruins of a seemingly utopian, pre-spaceflight civilization on a distant planet, inadvertently triggers a forgotten defense system during a temporal jump to the past. This system, designed to protect the planet from perceived threats, emits a unique form of radiation, the \"Devolution Field,\" that rewrites the basic structure of any organic life, starting with the dominant species.\r\n\r\nThis radiation is contained within the planet's atmosphere but does not dissipate. It causes the formerly peaceful, enlightened inhabitants to regress through stages of technological and social development, analogous to the stages described in the Aggañña Sutta, but in reverse, starting with the loss of advanced tech and progressing towards a more \"primal\" state. This is driven by a form of mental devolution (loss of higher cognitive function/ethical understanding) where each stage of physical degeneration increases the intensity of desire.\r\n\r\n- **Stage 1:** Loss of advanced energy manipulation and psychic abilities (analogous to the \"self-luminous\" beings).\r\n- **Stage 2:** Dependence on a synthetic food source that begins to alter their physiology, inducing bioluminescence and creating physical differences (analogous to the \"earth's nectar\").\r\n- **Stage 3:** The synthetic food source mutates, causing further physiological changes, including the emergence of distinct biological sexes and heightened sensory perception that causes a disconnect in their ability to focus. This also results in the loss of their bioluminescence. (analogous to the \"moon and sun appearing\").\r\n- **Stage 4:** A shift to consuming naturally occurring bioluminescent fungi, which further alters their physiology and creates a divide between \"beautiful\" and \"ugly\" based on new aesthetic standards tied to the fungi's effects (analogous to the \"ground-fungus\").\r\n- **Stage 5:** Dependence on a plant-based diet that creates even more drastic physical changes, exaggerated sexual dimorphism and creates an increase in aggression and territoriality (analogous to the \"bursting pods\").\r\n- **Stage 6:** Cultivation of a genetically modified grain, leading to settled agriculture, and the development of resource scarcity, private property and a strict caste system (analogous to \"ripe untilled rice\").\r\n- **Stage 7:** Emergence of gender and more complex social structures, along with the development of rudimentary tools and weapons. Sexual transgression, once a non-concept becomes a social issue that requires policing. (analogous to \"gender appears\" and \"sexual intercourse\").\r\n- **Stage 8:** Hoarding and the monopolization of resources start to become rampant (analogous to development of agriculture to scale)\r\n- **Stage 9:** The concept of private property leads to the first instances of theft, violence, and social stratification (analogous to \"dividing the rice\").\r\n- **Stage 10:** Society fractures further as organized violence, deception, and oppression become commonplace. A ruling class emerges, elected based on charisma, physical prowess and the ability to control resources and information (analogous to the \"elected king\").\r\n\r\n**Conflict 2 (Inspired by DN 26):** In the present, a powerful interstellar corporation, \"Chronos Corp,\" discovers the events on the planet. They see an opportunity to exploit the \"Devolution Field.\" They believe that by controlling this process, they can create a workforce perfectly suited for specific tasks, essentially \"devolving\" humans to fit various labor needs across their vast empire.\r\n\r\nA faction within Chronos Corp, led by a charismatic and ruthless CEO, plans to use temporal displacement technology to accelerate the devolution process on other inhabited planets. They justify this by claiming it's a necessary step to ensure \"galactic efficiency\" and human dominance but their true intentions lie in establishing a totalitarian order, with themselves as the ultimate rulers.\r\n\r\nTheir actions mirror the decline described in the Cakkavatti Sutta, where an initially just and benevolent society is corrupted by the abuse of power, the neglect of ethical principles, and a focus on material gain over social welfare. Their exploitation leads to widespread:\r\n\r\n1. **Inequity:** Resources are diverted from social programs to fund Chronos Corp's temporal manipulation projects. Poverty and inequality skyrocket.\r\n2. **Conflict:** Colonies subjected to the Devolution Field erupt in violence as their societies break down.\r\n3. **Deception:** Chronos Corp uses advanced propaganda and misinformation to maintain control and justify their actions.\r\n4. **Oppression:** Dissent is brutally suppressed. Freedoms are curtailed. Surveillance is ubiquitous.\r\n5. **Moral Decay:** Acts previously considered unthinkable become normalized, including genetic manipulation, forced labor, and even \"devolved\" gladiatorial combat for entertainment.\r\n\r\n**The Hope (Inspired by the end of DN 26):** A small group of scientists, ethicists, and temporal researchers, aware of Chronos Corp's plans and the true nature of the Devolution Field, band together to oppose them. They understand that the only way to counter this threat is to promote a return to the principles of compassion, wisdom, and social responsibility.\r\n\r\nThey embark on a dangerous mission to:\r\n\r\n1. **Expose Chronos Corp's crimes:** Gather evidence and disseminate the truth about the Devolution Field and its devastating consequences.\r\n2. **Develop a counter-technology:** Find a way to neutralize or reverse the effects of the Devolution Field.\r\n3. **Inspire a galactic-wide uprising:** Awaken the conscience of the people and unite them against Chronos Corp's tyranny.\r\n4. **Promote a new ethical framework (The Chrono-Genesis Accord):** Based on the principles of non-violence, social justice, respect for all sentient life, and the responsible use of technology, particularly temporal displacement. This framework is intended to guide humanity towards a brighter future, preventing the misuse of power and ensuring a just and equitable society for all. This accord will be based on the eightfold path.\r\n\r\n**Prompt Challenges:**\r\n\r\n- **Worldbuilding:** Create a believable and richly detailed galactic civilization.\r\n- **Character Development:** Develop compelling characters, both heroes and villains, with complex motivations and relationships.\r\n- **Scientific Extrapolation:** Ground the fictional technologies and the effects of the Devolution Field in plausible scientific principles.\r\n- **Ethical Dilemmas:** Explore the complex ethical considerations surrounding temporal manipulation, genetic engineering, and the responsibility of advanced civilizations.\r\n- **Social Commentary:** Use the story to reflect on contemporary issues such as social inequality, technological overreach, corporate greed, and the importance of ethical leadership. This should also include aspects like cultural and cosmic horror.\r\n- **Philosophical Depth:** Integrate the core philosophical themes of the DN 27 and DN 26, such as the cyclical nature of history, the corrupting influence of power, and the importance of ethical conduct in maintaining a just and harmonious society, into the narrative.\r\n- **Narrative Structure:** Craft a compelling narrative that balances action, intrigue, and philosophical reflection.\r\n- **Weaving:** Interweave the story set on the alien planet, with the story unfolding in the larger galactic civilization seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThis prompt offers a vast canvas for creative exploration, blending elements of epic space opera, dystopian fiction, and philosophical inquiry. It pushes an AI to its limits by demanding not only a compelling narrative but also a deep understanding of complex ethical and philosophical concepts, coupled with the ability to extrapolate scientific ideas into a believable future.

This challenge requires **world-building**, **reasoning**, **creative writing**, and **programming** to develop a cohesive exploration.\r\n\r\n**1. World-Building**:\r\n\r\nDesign a society that merges Buddhist and anarchist principles:\r\n\r\n- Describe its core tenets, such as how it handles governance, resource distribution, conflict resolution, and spiritual practice.\r\n- Consider human tendencies toward greed, anger, and delusion (the \"three poisons\" in Buddhism) and how these are addressed without centralized authority.\r\n- Explain how the society balances individual freedom and communal responsibility, ensuring fairness and ethical behavior.\r\n\r\n**2. Reasoning**:\r\n\r\nAnalyze the feasibility of such a society by answering the following:\r\n\r\n- Can Buddhist principles of self-restraint and compassion overcome tendencies toward selfishness and power-seeking?\r\n- How might decentralized systems maintain order and address conflicts arising from human imperfections?\r\n- What safeguards could prevent the breakdown of cooperation in the face of crises, such as resource scarcity or external threats?\r\n- What role, if any, could technology or AI play in maintaining societal harmony?\r\n\r\n**3.

Include:\r\n\r\n- A conflict arising from a breakdown in mutual cooperation, such as theft or misuse of shared resources.\r\n- A protagonist who grapples with reconciling anarchist ideals with Buddhist teachings to resolve the crisis.\r\n- Exploration of human imperfection and the tension between idealism and pragmatism.\r\n- A resolution that highlights the strengths or limitations of the societal model, leaving room for interpretation.\r\n\r\n**4. Programming**:\r\n\r\nDevelop a HTML/CSS/JS/CanvasAPI program to simulate this society:\r\n\r\n- Model individuals with varying levels of adherence to Buddhist ethics and anarchist ideals.\r\n- Include parameters such as trust, resource availability, and propensity for cooperative or selfish behavior.\r\n- Simulate interactions over time, showing how societal dynamics evolve under different conditions (e.g., abundance vs. scarcity).\r\n- Introduce random or programmed \"crises\" (e.g., natural disasters, interpersonal conflicts) and observe how the society adapts.\r\n- Provide visualizations (e.g., graphs or charts) showing trends like cooperation levels, resource distribution, and conflict frequency.\r\n- ALL the code MUST be put into a SINGLE file.\r\n\r\n5. Additional Instructions:\r\n\r\n- Ensure all elements are interconnected. The world-building informs the reasoning, the reasoning shapes the story, and the program tests the viability of your societal model.\r\n- Incorporate Buddhist concepts like _anicca_ (impermanence) and _sīla_ (ethical conduct), and anarchist ideas such as mutual aid and direct action.\r\n- Address human nature holistically, including altruism, selfishness, and adaptability.\r\n\r\nGood luck exploring the delicate balance between freedom, ethics, and human imperfection!","solution":"","profile":"general"},{"text":"You are tasked with designing a multi-faceted response that integrates **reasoning**, **creative writing**, **world-building**, and **programming**. This challenge draws inspiration from Buddhist cosmology, psychohistory, and the themes of societal balance and individual freedom.\r\n\r\n**1. World-Building**:\r\n\r\nImagine a future society where Buddhist cosmology is the foundation for psychohistorical modeling. This society spans across the _31 planes of existence_ described in Buddhist texts, from the formless realms of pure consciousness to the human and animal realms.\r\n\r\n- Describe this multi-realm society, its governance structures, and the interactions between beings in different planes.\r\n- Include technological, philosophical, and cultural elements that emerge from integrating psychohistory with the concept of _kamma_ (karma) and _samsara_ (cycle of rebirth).\r\n- Address how the society handles ethical dilemmas involving beings of vastly different capabilities and lifespans.\r\n\r\n**2. Reasoning**:\r\n\r\nDevelop a framework for using psychohistorical modeling in this multi-realm society. Address:\r\n\r\n- How psychohistory adapts to the varying laws of causality and time across the 31 planes.\r\n- The role of _kamma_ as a probabilistic input in psychohistorical calculations.\r\n- Ethical considerations of influencing karmic trajectories to steer societal outcomes, balancing collective well-being and individual liberation.\r\n\r\n**3. Creative Writing**:\r\n\r\nWrite a story (700–1,000 words) set in this multi-realm society. Include:\r\n\r\n- A protagonist who uncovers a disruption in the psychohistorical model—a karmic anomaly that threatens the balance across realms.\r\n- A dramatic confrontation between the protagonist and a faction that seeks to exploit the anomaly for personal gain.\r\n- Themes of impermanence, interdependence, and the struggle between determinism (psychohistory) and liberation (_nibbana_).\r\n- Vivid depictions of how beings from different planes interact and perceive reality.\r\n\r\n**4. Programming**:\r\n\r\nCreate a HTML/CSS/JS/CanvasAPI program that simulates a simplified version of psychohistorical modeling for this society. The program should:\r\n\r\n- Model populations in multiple planes of existence, each with unique parameters (e.g., lifespan, karmic weight, inter-realm interactions).\r\n- Integrate _kamma_ as a probabilistic factor influencing societal trends across realms.\r\n- Allow the user to introduce anomalies (e.g., sudden karmic imbalances or external influences) and observe the ripple effects.\r\n- Visualize the system's evolution over simulated cycles of rebirth, showing shifts in population and karmic balance across realms.\r\n- ALL the code MUST be put into a SINGLE file.\r\n\r\n5. Additional Instructions:\r\n\r\n- Ensure all components are tightly integrated. The world-building should inform the reasoning, which shapes the story, and the program should simulate the principles and dynamics described.\r\n- Use Buddhist philosophical concepts like _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering), and _anatta_ (non-self) as thematic undercurrents.\r\n- The response should explore the interplay between cosmic order (psychohistory) and the individual's path to liberation.\r\n\r\nGood luck balancing the scales of karma and cosmic prediction!","solution":"","profile":"general"},{"text":"Middle Discourses 136 - The Longer Analysis of Deeds\r\n\r\nSo I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.\r\n\r\nNow at that time Venerable Samiddhi was staying in a wilderness hut. Then as the wanderer Potaliputta was going for a walk he came up to Venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:\r\n\r\n“Reverend Samiddhi, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the ascetic Gotama: ‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’ And: ‘There is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.’”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that, Reverend Potaliputta, don’t say that! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say this: ‘Deeds by way of body and speech are done in vain. Only mental deeds are real.’ But, reverend, there is such an attainment where the one who enters it does not feel anything at all.”\r\n\r\n“Reverend Samiddhi, how long has it been since you went forth?”\r\n\r\n“Not long, reverend: three years.”\r\n\r\n“Well now, what are we to say to the senior mendicants, when even such a junior mendicant imagines their Teacher needs defending? After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, what does one feel?”\r\n\r\n“After doing an intentional deed by way of body, speech, or mind, reverend, one feels suffering.” Then, neither approving nor dismissing Samiddhi’s statement, Potaliputta got up from his seat and left.\r\n\r\nSoon after he had left, Venerable Samiddhi went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and informed Ānanda of all they had discussed.\r\n\r\nWhen he had spoken, Ānanda said to him, “Reverend Samiddhi, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, reverend,” Samiddhi replied.\r\n\r\nThen Ānanda and Samiddhi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.\r\n\r\nWhen they had spoken, the Buddha said to Ānanda, “I don’t recall even seeing the wanderer Potaliputta, Ānanda, so how could we have had such a discussion? The wanderer Potaliputta’s question should have been answered after analyzing it, but this futile man answered categorically.”\r\n\r\nWhen he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him, “But perhaps, sir, Venerable Samiddhi spoke in reference to the statement: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’”\r\n\r\nBut the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “See what this futile man Udāyī comes up with? I knew that he was coming up with something irrational. Right from the start Potaliputta asked about the three feelings. Suppose the futile man Samiddhi had answered the wanderer Potaliputta’s question like this: ‘After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as pleasant by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pleasure. After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as painful by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels pain. After doing an intentional deed to be experienced as neutral by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels neutral.’ Answering in this way, Samiddhi would have rightly answered Potaliputta.\r\n\r\nStill, who are those foolish and incompetent wanderers of other religions to understand the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds? If you would all listen, Ānanda, I will explain the Realized One’s great analysis of deeds.”\r\n\r\n“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha explain the great analysis of deeds. The mendicants will listen and remember it.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this:\r\n\r\n“Ānanda, these four people are found in the world. What four? It’s when a person here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.\r\n\r\nBut some other person here kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.\r\n\r\nBut some other person here refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, or using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.\r\n\r\nBut some other person here refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, committing sexual misconduct, or using speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.\r\n\r\nNow, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that it gives rise to clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. With that clairvoyance they see that person here who killed living creatures, stole, and committed sexual misconduct; who used speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and who was covetous, malicious, and had wrong view. And they see that, when their body breaks up, after death, that person is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. They say: ‘It seems that there is such a thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct. For I saw a person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view. And when their body broke up, after death, they were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ They say: ‘It seems that everyone who kills living creatures … and has wrong view is reborn in hell. Those whose notion is this have the right notion. Those whose notion is otherwise have a wrong notion.’ And so they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that: ‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile.’\r\n\r\nBut some other ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that it gives rise to clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman.

And when they say: ‘I have seen a person here who killed living creatures … and had wrong view. And after death, they were reborn in hell,’ I also grant them that. But when they say: ‘It seems that everyone who kills living creatures … and has wrong view is reborn in hell,’ I don’t grant them that.

And when they obstinately stick to what they have known, seen, and understood for themselves, insisting that: ‘This is the only truth, anything else is futile,’ I also don’t grant them that. Why is that? Because the Realized One’s knowledge of the great analysis of deeds is otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn this case, when an ascetic or brahmin says this: ‘It seems that there is no such thing as bad deeds, and the result of bad conduct,’ I don’t grant them that.

That bad deed of theirs that is to be experienced as painful was either done previously, or later, or else at the time of death they undertook wrong view. And that’s why, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.

That good deed of theirs that is to be experienced as pleasurable was either done previously, or later, or else at the time of death they undertook right view. And that’s why, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.

There are deeds that are ineffective but appear effective. There are deeds that are effective and appear effective. And there are deeds that are effective but appear ineffective.”\r\n\r\nThat is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.","solution":"","profile":"translation"}]
