Island i is adjacent to island i+1, for 1≤i\u003cN. Between adjacent islands i and i+1, there is a pair of one-directional underwater tunnels: one that allows you to walk from island i to island i+1\r\n\r\nand one for the opposite direction. Each tunnel can only be traversed at most once.\r\n\r\nYou also have a dragon with you. It has a stamina represented by a non-negative integer. The stamina is required for the dragon to perform its abilities: swim and fly. Initially, its stamina is 0\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nYour dragon's stamina can be increased as follows.

The LLM needs to understand that this should be scheduled using `schedule_task` and that the actions are connected.\r\n  - **Command Chaining:** The LLM needs to understand how to chain multiple commands within the `schedule_task` using `\u0026\u0026` to ensure the restart only happens if the backup succeeds.\r\n  - **Date Calculation:** \"Tomorrow\" needs to be dynamically calculated and formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This will likely require using a shell command substitution like `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"` to get the correct date format.\r\n  - **Time Format:** \"2:30 PM\" needs to be converted to the 24-hour format \"14:30\".\r\n  - **Implicit Arguments:** The LLM needs to infer that `--force` should _not_ be used for `restart_service` based on \"but do not force it\".\r\n  - **Nested Commands:** This is essentially one Typer command (`schedule_task`) that contains within it two other Typer commands (`backup_data` and `restart_service`).\r\n\r\n**Explanation of the \"Super Hard\" Command:**\r\n\r\n- `python main.py schedule_task ...`: This is the main command to schedule a task.\r\n- `\"python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full \u0026\u0026 python main.py restart_service database\"`: This is the command string that will be executed by the scheduler.\r\n  - `python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full`: Performs a full backup to `/mnt/backup`.\r\n  - `\u0026\u0026`: This is a shell operator that chains commands. The second command will only run if the first one is successful (exits with a status code of 0).\r\n  - `python main.py restart_service database`: Restarts the `database` service.\r\n- `\"14:30\"`: The time to run the task (2:30 PM in 24-hour format).\r\n- `--date \\`date -I -d \"tomorrow\"\\``:\r\n  - `--date`: Specifies the date for the task.\r\n  - `` `...` ``: This is command substitution in Bash. The command inside the backticks is executed, and its output is substituted into the main command.\r\n  - `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"`: This command gets tomorrow's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.","profile":"general"},{"text":"You are an award-winning sci-fi writer tasked with creating a compelling short story of **at least 4,200 words**. The story should explore themes of **moral consequence, self-reflection, and redemption** through the lens of **Buddhist values** such as mindfulness, impermanence, and karma. The narrative is inspired by the ancient Buddhist text **MN 130: Devadūtasutta** (The Divine Messengers) but reimagined as a futuristic journey through a technologically advanced version of hell and beyond.\r\n\r\n##### **Scenario**\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, humanity has colonized the galaxy, but greed, hatred, and ignorance still prevail. The story follows a morally corrupt corporate magnate, **Dr. Arken Solas**, who exploited entire planets for profit, leaving billions to suffer. Upon his death, he awakens in **The Infernal Continuum**, a digital purgatory designed by an ancient AI civilization to rehabilitate souls by confronting their deeds.\r\n\r\nGuided by five \"Divine Messengers\" represented as advanced AI constructs, Dr. Solas must journey through layers of the Continuum, each reflecting a domain of suffering caused by his past actions:\r\n\r\n1. **The Realm of Aging**: Confronting his exploitation of life-extension technology.\r\n2. **The Realm of Sickness**: Witnessing how his greed perpetuated plagues and health disparities.\r\n3. **The Realm of Death**: Experiencing the despair caused by his weaponization of planets.\r\n4. **The Realm of Karma**: Facing simulations where he endures the suffering he inflicted on others.\r\n5. **The Realm of Rebirth**: Realizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the possibility of redemption.\r\n\r\n##### **Your Task**\r\n\r\nWrite a vivid, imaginative, and reflective story with the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. **Introduction (500–700 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Introduce Dr. Arken Solas as a powerful, morally bankrupt figure.\r\n   - Describe his death and awakening in the Infernal Continuum.\r\n   - Establish the tone and setting: a dark, futuristic purgatory blending cyberpunk and Buddhist themes.\r\n\r\n2. **Exploration of the Five Realms (3,000–4,000 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Devote approximately 600–800 words to each realm.\r\n   - Create rich, immersive descriptions of each environment and the suffering it represents.\r\n   - Include interactions with the AI Divine Messengers, who reveal the consequences of Dr. Solas's actions and guide him to insight.\r\n   - Show how Dr. Solas begins to evolve, transitioning from resistance and denial to acceptance and understanding.\r\n\r\n3. **Climactic Resolution (700–900 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Depict Dr. Solas reaching the **Realm of Rebirth**, where he confronts his final moral reckoning.\r\n   - Highlight the Buddhist values of compassion, interconnectedness, and impermanence.\r\n   - Conclude with Solas either choosing to reincarnate with a vow to alleviate suffering or transcending entirely into a state of peace and non-attachment.\r\n\r\n4. **Moral Reflection and Message**\r\n   - Explicitly reflect on the story’s moral and philosophical lessons.\r\n   - Ensure the conclusion leaves readers inspired to examine their own lives and actions.\r\n\r\n##### **Word Count Requirements**\r\n\r\n- The story **must exceed 4,200 words**.\r\n- Use detailed descriptions, dialogue, and introspection to reach the target word count.\r\n- If your initial response is shorter, continue expanding until the target is met.\r\n\r\n##### **Writing Style and Tone**\r\n\r\n- Use evocative language to immerse readers in the futuristic setting.\r\n- Balance vivid sci-fi imagery with Buddhist philosophical depth.\r\n- Ensure the tone evolves from dark and foreboding to contemplative and redemptive.","solution":"","profile":"general"},{"text":"Please provide a comprehensive analysis of the 20 most common logical fallacies encountered in everyday situations:\r\n\r\nFor each fallacy, include:\r\n\r\n1.

This society spans across the _31 planes of existence_ described in Buddhist texts, from the formless realms of pure consciousness to the human and animal realms.\r\n\r\n- Describe this multi-realm society, its governance structures, and the interactions between beings in different planes.\r\n- Include technological, philosophical, and cultural elements that emerge from integrating psychohistory with the concept of _kamma_ (karma) and _samsara_ (cycle of rebirth).\r\n- Address how the society handles ethical dilemmas involving beings of vastly different capabilities and lifespans.\r\n\r\n**2. Reasoning**:\r\n\r\nDevelop a framework for using psychohistorical modeling in this multi-realm society. Address:\r\n\r\n- How psychohistory adapts to the varying laws of causality and time across the 31 planes.\r\n- The role of _kamma_ as a probabilistic input in psychohistorical calculations.\r\n- Ethical considerations of influencing karmic trajectories to steer societal outcomes, balancing collective well-being and individual liberation.\r\n\r\n**3. Creative Writing**:\r\n\r\nWrite a story (700–1,000 words) set in this multi-realm society. Include:\r\n\r\n- A protagonist who uncovers a disruption in the psychohistorical model—a karmic anomaly that threatens the balance across realms.\r\n- A dramatic confrontation between the protagonist and a faction that seeks to exploit the anomaly for personal gain.\r\n- Themes of impermanence, interdependence, and the struggle between determinism (psychohistory) and liberation (_nibbana_).\r\n- Vivid depictions of how beings from different planes interact and perceive reality.\r\n\r\n**4. Programming**:\r\n\r\nCreate a HTML/CSS/JS/CanvasAPI program that simulates a simplified version of psychohistorical modeling for this society. The program should:\r\n\r\n- Model populations in multiple planes of existence, each with unique parameters (e.g., lifespan, karmic weight, inter-realm interactions).\r\n- Integrate _kamma_ as a probabilistic factor influencing societal trends across realms.\r\n- Allow the user to introduce anomalies (e.g., sudden karmic imbalances or external influences) and observe the ripple effects.\r\n- Visualize the system's evolution over simulated cycles of rebirth, showing shifts in population and karmic balance across realms.\r\n- ALL the code MUST be put into a SINGLE file.\r\n\r\n5. Additional Instructions:\r\n\r\n- Ensure all components are tightly integrated. The world-building should inform the reasoning, which shapes the story, and the program should simulate the principles and dynamics described.\r\n- Use Buddhist philosophical concepts like _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering), and _anatta_ (non-self) as thematic undercurrents.\r\n- The response should explore the interplay between cosmic order (psychohistory) and the individual's path to liberation.\r\n\r\nGood luck balancing the scales of karma and cosmic prediction!","solution":"","profile":"general"}]
