At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants, “Reverends, mendicants!”\r\n\r\n“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this:\r\n\r\n“The footprints of all creatures that walk can fit inside an elephant’s footprint, so an elephant’s footprint is said to be the biggest of them all. In the same way, all skillful qualities are included in the four noble truths. What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the noble truth of suffering? Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. And what are the five grasping aggregates? They are as follows: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the grasping aggregate of form? The four principal states, and form derived from the four principal states.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the four principal states? The elements of earth, water, fire, and air.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the earth element? The earth element may be interior or exterior. And what is the interior earth element? Anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This includes: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s hard, solid, and appropriated. This is called the interior earth element. The interior earth element and the exterior earth element are just the earth element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the earth element, detaching the mind from the earth element.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when the exterior water element flares up. At that time the exterior earth element vanishes. So for all its great age, the earth element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things.\r\n\r\nIf others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand: ‘This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me. That’s dependent, not independent. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact.’ They see that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent. Based on that element alone, their mind leaps forth, gains confidence, settles down, and becomes decided.\r\n\r\nOthers might treat that mendicant with disliking, loathing, and detestation, striking them with fists, stones, sticks, and swords. They understand: ‘This body is such that fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike it. But the Buddha has said in the Advice on the Simile of the Saw:\r\n\r\n“Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb with a two-handed saw, anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions.” My energy shall be roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness established and lucid, my body tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind immersed in samādhi. Gladly now, let fists, stones, sticks, and swords strike this body! For this is how the instructions of the Buddhas are followed.’\r\n\r\nWhile recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful may not become stabilized in them. In that case they stir up a sense of urgency: ‘It’s my loss, my misfortune, that while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does not become stabilized in me.’ They’re like a daughter-in-law who stirs up a sense of urgency when they see their father-in-law. But if, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that. At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the water element? The water element may be interior or exterior. And what is the interior water element? Anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s water, watery, and appropriated. This includes: bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s water, watery, and appropriated. This is called the interior water element. The interior water element and the exterior water element are just the water element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the water element, detaching the mind from the water element.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when the exterior water element flares up. It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions. There comes a time when the water in the ocean sinks down a hundred leagues, or two, three, four, five, six, up to seven hundred leagues. There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven palm trees deep, or six, five, four, three, two, or even just one palm tree deep. There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just seven fathoms deep, or six, five, four, three, two, or even just one fathom deep. There comes a time when the water in the ocean stands just half a fathom deep, or waist deep, or knee deep, or even just ankle deep. There comes a time when there’s not even enough water left in the great ocean to wet the tip of the toe. So for all its great age, the water element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things. … If, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that. At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the fire element? The fire element may be interior or exterior. And what is the interior fire element? Anything internal, pertaining to an individual that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated. This includes: that which warms, that which ages, that which heats you up when feverish, that which properly digests food and drink; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s fire, fiery, and appropriated. This is called the interior fire element. The interior fire element and the exterior fire element are just the fire element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the fire element, detaching the mind from the fire element.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when the exterior fire element flares up. It burns up villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions until it reaches a green field, a roadside, a cliff’s edge, a body of water, or cleared parkland, where it’s extinguished due to not being fed. There comes a time when they go looking for a fire, taking just a chicken feather or a scrap of sinew as kindling. So for all its great age, the fire element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things. …\r\n\r\nIf, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that. At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the air element? The air element may be interior or exterior. And what is the interior air element? Anything internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s air, airy, and appropriated. This includes: winds that go up or down, winds in the belly or the bowels, winds that flow through the limbs, in-breaths and out-breaths; or anything else internal, pertaining to an individual, that’s air, airy, and appropriated. This is called the interior air element. The interior air element and the exterior air element are just the air element. This should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ When you truly see with right understanding, you grow disillusioned with the air element, detaching the mind from the air element.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when the exterior air element flares up. It sweeps away villages, towns, cities, countries, and regions. There comes a time, in the last month of summer, when they look for wind by using a palm-leaf or fan, and even the grasses in the drip-fringe of a thatch roof don’t stir. So for all its great age, the air element will be revealed as impermanent, liable to end, vanish, and perish. What then of this ephemeral body appropriated by craving? Rather than ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’, they consider it to be none of these things.\r\n\r\nIf others abuse, attack, harass, and trouble that mendicant, they understand: ‘This painful feeling born of ear contact has arisen in me. That’s dependent, not independent. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact.’ They see that contact, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.

But if, while recollecting the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in this way, equanimity based on the skillful does become stabilized in them, they’re happy with that. At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.\r\n\r\nWhen a space is enclosed by sticks, creepers, grass, and mud it becomes known as a ‘building’. In the same way, when a space is enclosed by bones, sinews, flesh, and skin it becomes known as a ‘form’.\r\n\r\nReverends, though the eye is intact internally, so long as exterior sights don’t come into range and there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness. Though the eye is intact internally and exterior sights come into range, so long as there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness. But when the eye is intact internally and exterior sights come into range and there is corresponding engagement, there is the manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe form produced in this way is included in the grasping aggregate of form. The feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness produced in this way are each included in the corresponding grasping aggregate.\r\n\r\nThey understand: ‘So this is how there comes to be inclusion, gathering together, and joining together into these five grasping aggregates. But the Buddha has said: “One who sees dependent origination sees the teaching. One who sees the teaching sees dependent origination.” And these five grasping aggregates are indeed dependently originated. The desire, clinging, attraction, and attachment for these five grasping aggregates is the origin of suffering. Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering.’ At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.\r\n\r\nThough the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind is intact internally, so long as exterior ideas don’t come into range and there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThough the mind is intact internally and exterior ideas come into range, so long as there’s no corresponding engagement, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.

Giving up and getting rid of desire and greed for these five grasping aggregates is the cessation of suffering.’ At this point, much has been done by that mendicant.”\r\n\r\nThat’s what Venerable Sāriputta said.

The LLM needs to understand that this should be scheduled using `schedule_task` and that the actions are connected.\r\n  - **Command Chaining:** The LLM needs to understand how to chain multiple commands within the `schedule_task` using `\u0026\u0026` to ensure the restart only happens if the backup succeeds.\r\n  - **Date Calculation:** \"Tomorrow\" needs to be dynamically calculated and formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This will likely require using a shell command substitution like `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"` to get the correct date format.\r\n  - **Time Format:** \"2:30 PM\" needs to be converted to the 24-hour format \"14:30\".\r\n  - **Implicit Arguments:** The LLM needs to infer that `--force` should _not_ be used for `restart_service` based on \"but do not force it\".\r\n  - **Nested Commands:** This is essentially one Typer command (`schedule_task`) that contains within it two other Typer commands (`backup_data` and `restart_service`).\r\n\r\n**Explanation of the \"Super Hard\" Command:**\r\n\r\n- `python main.py schedule_task ...`: This is the main command to schedule a task.\r\n- `\"python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full \u0026\u0026 python main.py restart_service database\"`: This is the command string that will be executed by the scheduler.\r\n  - `python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full`: Performs a full backup to `/mnt/backup`.\r\n  - `\u0026\u0026`: This is a shell operator that chains commands. The second command will only run if the first one is successful (exits with a status code of 0).\r\n  - `python main.py restart_service database`: Restarts the `database` service.\r\n- `\"14:30\"`: The time to run the task (2:30 PM in 24-hour format).\r\n- `--date \\`date -I -d \"tomorrow\"\\``:\r\n  - `--date`: Specifies the date for the task.\r\n  - `` `...` ``: This is command substitution in Bash. The command inside the backticks is executed, and its output is substituted into the main command.\r\n  - `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"`: This command gets tomorrow's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.","profile":"programming"},{"text":"# Three Minimums\r\n\r\nGiven a list of distinct values, we denote with $\\text{first minimum}$, $\\text{second minimum}$, and $\\text{third minimum}$ the three smallest values (in increasing order).\r\n\r\nA permutation $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ is $\\text{good}$ if the following statement holds for all pairs $(l,r)$ with $1 \\leq l \u003c l + 2 \\leq r \\leq n$.\r\n\r\n* If $\\{p_l, p_r\\}$ are (not necessarily in this order) the first and second minimum of $p_l, p_{l+1}, \\ldots, p_r$, then the third minimum of $p_l, p_{l+1}, \\ldots, p_r$ is either $p_{l+1}$ or $p_{r-1}$.\r\n\r\nYou are given an integer $n$ and a string $s$ of length $m$ consisting of characters \"\u003c\" and \"\u003e\".\r\n\r\nCount the number of $\\text{good}$ permutations $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$ such that, for all $1 \\leq i \\leq m$:\r\n\r\n* $p_i \u003c p_{i+1}$ if $s_i = $ \"\u003c\";\r\n* $p_i \u003e p_{i+1}$ if $s_i = $ \"\u003e\".\r\n\r\nAs the result can be very large, you should print it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\r\n\r\n## Input\r\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5, 1 \\leq m \\leq \\min(100, n - 1))$.\r\n\r\nThe second line contains a string $s$ of length $m$, consisting of characters \"\u003c\" and \"\u003e\".\r\n\r\n## Output\r\nPrint a single integer: the number of $\\text{good}$ permutations satisfying the constraints described in the statement, modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### input\r\n```\r\n5 3\r\n\u003e\u003e\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### output\r\n```\r\n5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### input\r\n```\r\n5 1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### output\r\n```\r\n56\r\n```\r\n\r\n### input\r\n```\r\n6 5\r\n\u003c\u003c\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### output\r\n```\r\n23\r\n```\r\n\r\n### input\r\n```\r\n10 5\r\n\u003e\u003c\u003c\u003e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### output\r\n```\r\n83154\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nIn the first test, there are 5 good permutations satisfying the constraints given by the string $s$: $[4, 3, 2, 1, 5]$, $[5, 3, 2, 1, 4]$, $[5, 4, 2, 1, 3]$, $[5, 4, 3, 1, 2]$, $[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$.

This station has two platforms, and between them there are $m$ parallel railways that can be viewed as infinite straight lines. Each railway is identified with an integer from $1$ to $m$, railway $1$ being the closest to the first platform and railway $m$ being the farthest. There is a $1$ meter distance between consecutive railways, as well as between each platform and its closest railway.\r\n\r\nIsona is standing on the inner border of the first platform, when she realizes that she forgot to validate her ticket! There is a validating machine on the second platform, exactly opposite her current position (that is, the distance between Isona and the validating machine is $m + 1$ meters). There are only $s$ seconds left to validate the ticket and the bridge designated to cross the railways is too far from the validating machine. Therefore, Isona (who is very brave and a little bit careless) will cross the railways running in a straight line perpendicular to the railways themselves. Isona can only run forward (not backward) and **she can stay still**. When she runs at maximum speed, she needs $v$ seconds to traverse $1$ meter. She can run at any speed less than or equal to her maximum speed.\r\n\r\nThere is only one problem: $n$ trains are programmed to transit through the railways. The $i$-th train will use the railway $r_i$. It will start crossing the straight line between Isona and the validating machine $a_i$ seconds from now and it will end $b_i$ seconds from now. Of course, Isona cannot cross a railway when a train is passing. Formally, for every $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n$, Isona is not allowed to be on railway $r_i$ at any time $t$ with $a_i \u003c t \u003c b_i$ (but she is allowed to cross at times $a_i$ or $b_i$).\r\n\r\nThe following picture summarizes the situation. In the picture there are $m = 4$ railways and two trains are visible; the train going through railway $3$ is currently crossing the line between Isona and the validating machine.\r\n\r\n```\r\n                      VALIDATING MACHINE\r\n                -----------------------------\r\n  (4) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n  (3) - - - - [===================] - - - - -\r\n  (2) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n  (1) - - - - - - [==================] - - - | 1 m\r\n        - - - - - - - ISONA - - - - - - - - \r\n```\r\n\r\nIsona is a really good runner, but she gets tired every time she has to change her running speed. What is the minimum number of speed changes she has to perform to get to the validating machine on the other platform within $s$ seconds from now? Note that at the beginning Isona is not running. She can start to run anytime. The instant she starts to run (i.e. her velocity becomes positive) is **not** counted as a speed change.\r\n\r\n## Input\r\n\r\nThe first line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $s$, $v$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 500$, $1 \\leq m \\leq 10$, $1 \\leq s, v \\leq 10^9$) — the number of trains, the number of railways, the maximum time in seconds Isona can spend crossing the railways, and the number of seconds she needs to traverse $1$ meter at maximum speed.\r\n\r\nEach of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $a_i$, $b_i$, $r_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i \u003c b_i \\leq 10^9$, $1 \\leq r_i \\leq m$) — the start and end times of the $i$-th train crossing the straight line between Isona and the validating machine, and the railway it will be using.\r\n\r\nIt is guaranteed that, for any two trains $i$ and $j$ that go through the same railway (i.e. $r_i = r_j$), there is at least $1$ second between them (that is, either $a_j \\geq b_i + 1$ or $a_i \\geq b_j + 1$).\r\n\r\n## Output\r\n\r\nPrint the minimum number of speed changes Isona has to perform to get to the validating machine in time.

The story should explore themes of **moral consequence, self-reflection, and redemption** through the lens of **Buddhist values** such as mindfulness, impermanence, and karma. The narrative is inspired by the ancient Buddhist text **MN 130: Devadūtasutta** (The Divine Messengers) but reimagined as a futuristic journey through a technologically advanced version of hell and beyond.\r\n\r\n##### **Scenario**\r\n\r\nIn the distant future, humanity has colonized the galaxy, but greed, hatred, and ignorance still prevail. The story follows a morally corrupt corporate magnate, **Dr. Arken Solas**, who exploited entire planets for profit, leaving billions to suffer. Upon his death, he awakens in **The Infernal Continuum**, a digital purgatory designed by an ancient AI civilization to rehabilitate souls by confronting their deeds.\r\n\r\nGuided by five \"Divine Messengers\" represented as advanced AI constructs, Dr. Solas must journey through layers of the Continuum, each reflecting a domain of suffering caused by his past actions:\r\n\r\n1. **The Realm of Aging**: Confronting his exploitation of life-extension technology.\r\n2. **The Realm of Sickness**: Witnessing how his greed perpetuated plagues and health disparities.\r\n3. **The Realm of Death**: Experiencing the despair caused by his weaponization of planets.\r\n4. **The Realm of Karma**: Facing simulations where he endures the suffering he inflicted on others.\r\n5. **The Realm of Rebirth**: Realizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the possibility of redemption.\r\n\r\n##### **Your Task**\r\n\r\nWrite a vivid, imaginative, and reflective story with the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. **Introduction (500–700 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Introduce Dr. Arken Solas as a powerful, morally bankrupt figure.\r\n   - Describe his death and awakening in the Infernal Continuum.\r\n   - Establish the tone and setting: a dark, futuristic purgatory blending cyberpunk and Buddhist themes.\r\n\r\n2. **Exploration of the Five Realms (3,000–4,000 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Devote approximately 600–800 words to each realm.\r\n   - Create rich, immersive descriptions of each environment and the suffering it represents.\r\n   - Include interactions with the AI Divine Messengers, who reveal the consequences of Dr. Solas's actions and guide him to insight.\r\n   - Show how Dr. Solas begins to evolve, transitioning from resistance and denial to acceptance and understanding.\r\n\r\n3. **Climactic Resolution (700–900 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Depict Dr. Solas reaching the **Realm of Rebirth**, where he confronts his final moral reckoning.\r\n   - Highlight the Buddhist values of compassion, interconnectedness, and impermanence.\r\n   - Conclude with Solas either choosing to reincarnate with a vow to alleviate suffering or transcending entirely into a state of peace and non-attachment.\r\n\r\n4. **Moral Reflection and Message**\r\n   - Explicitly reflect on the story’s moral and philosophical lessons.\r\n   - Ensure the conclusion leaves readers inspired to examine their own lives and actions.\r\n\r\n##### **Word Count Requirements**\r\n\r\n- The story **must exceed 4,200 words**.\r\n- Use detailed descriptions, dialogue, and introspection to reach the target word count.\r\n- If your initial response is shorter, continue expanding until the target is met.\r\n\r\n##### **Writing Style and Tone**\r\n\r\n- Use evocative language to immerse readers in the futuristic setting.\r\n- Balance vivid sci-fi imagery with Buddhist philosophical depth.\r\n- Ensure the tone evolves from dark and foreboding to contemplative and redemptive.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMiddle Discourses 130 - Messengers of the Gods\r\n\r\nSo I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”\r\n\r\n“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:\r\n\r\n“Mendicants, suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, or among humans. These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm, the animal realm, or in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying, ‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family. May Your Majesty punish them!’\r\n\r\nKing Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first messenger of the gods. ‘Worthy man, did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings a little baby collapsed in their own urine and feces?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw that, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to be born. I’m not exempt from rebirth. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’\r\n\r\nThen King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods. ‘Worthy man, did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a man—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw that, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to grow old. I’m not exempt from old age. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’\r\n\r\nThen King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the gods. ‘Worthy man, did you not see the third messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in their own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw that, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to become sick. I’m not exempt from sickness. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’ He says, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’\r\n\r\nThen King Yama grills them about the fourth messenger of the gods. ‘Worthy man, did you not see the fourth messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings when the rulers arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw that, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—that if someone who does bad deeds receives such punishment in this very life, what must happen to them in the next; I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’\r\n\r\nThen King Yama grills them about the fifth messenger of the gods. ‘Worthy man, did you not see the fifth messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I saw that, sir.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to die. I’m not exempt from death. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’\r\n\r\nHe says, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’\r\n\r\nKing Yama says to them, ‘Worthy man, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’\r\n\r\nAfter grilling them about the fifth messenger of the gods, King Yama falls silent.\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion. They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. …\r\n\r\nThey hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. …\r\n\r\nThey harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. …\r\n\r\nThey make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. …\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing. There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell. Now, about that Great Hell:\r\n\r\n    ‘Four are its corners, four its doors, neatly divided in equal parts. Surrounded by an iron wall, of iron is its roof.\r\n\r\n    The ground is even made of iron, it burns with fierce fire. The heat forever radiates a hundred leagues around.’ \r\n\r\nNow in the Great Hell, flames surge out of the walls and crash into the opposite wall: from east to west, from west to east, from north to south, from south to north, from bottom to top, from top to bottom. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened. So they run there as fast as they can. And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape; but when they’ve managed to make it most of the way, the gate is slammed shut. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the western gate … northern gate … southern gate of the Great Hell is opened. So they run there as fast as they can. And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape; but when they’ve managed to make it most of the way, the gate is slammed shut. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the eastern gate of the Great Hell is opened. So they run there as fast as they can. And as they run, their outer skin, inner skin, flesh, and sinews burn and even their bones smoke. Such is their escape; and they make it out that door.\r\n\r\nImmediately adjacent to the Great Hell is the vast Dung Hell. And that’s where they fall. In that Dung Hell there are needle-mouthed creatures that bore through the outer skin, the inner skin, the flesh, sinews, and bones, until they reach the marrow and devour it. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nImmediately adjacent to the Dung Hell is the vast Hell of Burning Chaff. And that’s where they fall. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nImmediately adjacent to the Hell of Burning Chaff is the vast Red Silk-Cotton Forest. It’s a league high, full of sixteen-inch thorns, burning, blazing, and glowing. And there they make them climb up and down. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nImmediately adjacent to the Red Silk-Cotton Forest is the vast Sword-Leaf Forest. They enter that. There the fallen leaves blown by the wind cut their hands, feet, both hands and feet; they cut their ears, nose, both ears and nose. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nImmediately adjacent to the Sword-Leaf Forest is the vast Acid River. And that’s where they fall. There they are swept upstream, swept downstream, and swept both up and down stream. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell pull them out with a hook and place them on dry land, and say, ‘Worthy man, what do you want?’\r\n\r\nThey say, ‘I’m hungry, sir.’\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, glowing—and shove in a red-hot copper ball, burning, blazing, and glowing. It burns their lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails. And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell say, ‘Worthy man, what do you want?’\r\n\r\nThey say, ‘I’m thirsty, sir.’\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell force open their mouth with a hot iron spike—burning, blazing, glowing—and pour in molten copper, burning, blazing, and glowing. It burns their lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and stomach before coming out below dragging their entrails. And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated.\r\n\r\nThe wardens of hell toss them back in the Great Hell.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, King Yama thought: ‘Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments. Oh, I hope I may be reborn as a human being! And that a Realized One—a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—arises in the world! And that I may pay homage to the Buddha! Then the Buddha can teach me Dhamma, so that I may understand his teaching.’\r\n\r\nNow, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.”\r\n\r\nThat is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say:\r\n\r\n    “When warned by the gods’ messengers, those people who are negligent sorrow for a long time when they go to that wretched place.\r\n\r\n    When warned by the gods’ messengers, the good and true persons here never neglect the teaching of the Noble One.\r\n\r\n    Seeing the danger in grasping, the origin of birth and death, the unattached are freed with the ending of birth and death.\r\n\r\n    Happy, they’ve come to a safe place, quenched in this very life. They’ve gone beyond all threats and perils, and risen above all suffering.” ","solution":"","profile":"writing"},{"text":"Base on MN 81 below, write an original novel with a moving story, but set in the far future where the earth become super advanced and human live to eighty thousand years old.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMiddle Discourses 81 - With Ghaṭīkāra\r\n\r\nSo I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. Then the Buddha left the road, and at a certain spot he smiled.\r\n\r\nThen Venerable Ānanda thought, “What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled? Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”\r\n\r\nSo Ānanda arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, “What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled? Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.”\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of people. And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga. It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery, where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.”\r\n\r\nThen Ānanda spread out his outer robe folded in four and said to the Buddha, “Well then, sir, may the Blessed One sit here! Then this piece of land will have been occupied by two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.” The Buddha sat on the seat spread out. When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda:\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a market town in this spot named Vebhaliṅga. It was successful and prosperous, populous, full of people. And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by Vebhaliṅga. It was here, in fact, that he had his monastery, where he advised the mendicant Saṅgha while seated.\r\n\r\nThe Buddha Kassapa had as chief supporter in Vebhaliṅga a potter named Ghaṭīkāra. Ghaṭīkāra had a dear friend named Jotipāla, a student. Then Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla, ‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’\r\n\r\nWhen he said this, Jotipāla said to him, ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra. What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’\r\n\r\nFor a second time … and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla, ‘Come, dear Jotipāla, let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’\r\n\r\nFor a third time, Jotipāla said to him, ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra. What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’\r\n\r\n‘Well then, dear Jotipāla, let’s take some bathing cleanser and go to the river to bathe.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, dear,’ replied Jotipāla. So that’s what they did.\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla, ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away. Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’\r\n\r\nWhen he said this, Jotipāla said to him, ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra. What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’\r\n\r\nFor a second time … and a third time, Ghaṭīkāra addressed Jotipāla, ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away. Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’\r\n\r\nFor a third time, Jotipāla said to him, ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra. What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the skirt-hem and said, ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away. Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’\r\n\r\nSo Jotipāla undid his skirt-hem and said to Ghaṭīkāra, ‘Enough, dear Ghaṭīkāra. What’s the use of seeing that shaveling, that fake ascetic?’\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra grabbed Jotipāla by the hair of his freshly-washed head and said, ‘Dear Jotipāla, the Buddha Kassapa’s monastery is not far away. Let’s go to see the Blessed One Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For I deem it holy to see that Blessed One.’\r\n\r\nThen Jotipāla thought, ‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing, how this potter Ghaṭīkāra, though of lowly birth, should presume to grab me by the hair of my freshly-washed head! This must be no ordinary matter.’ He said to Ghaṭīkāra, ‘You’d even milk it to this extent, dear Ghaṭīkāra?’\r\n\r\n‘I even milk it to this extent, dear Jotipāla. For that is how holy I deem it to see that Blessed One.’\r\n\r\n‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, release me, we shall go.’\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra the potter and Jotipāla the student went to the Buddha Kassapa. Ghaṭīkāra bowed and sat down to one side, but Jotipāla exchanged greetings with the Buddha and sat down to one side.\r\n\r\nGhaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir, this is the student Jotipāla, my dear friend. Please teach him the Dhamma.’ Then the Buddha Kassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla with a Dhamma talk. Then they got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha Kassapa, keeping him on their right, before leaving.\r\n\r\nThen Jotipāla said to Ghatīkāra, ‘Dear Ghaṭīkāra, you have heard this teaching, so why don’t you go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’\r\n\r\n‘Don’t you know, dear Jotipāla, that I provide for my blind old parents?’\r\n\r\n‘Well then, dear Ghaṭīkāra, I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra and Jotipāla went to the Buddha Kassapa, bowed and sat down to one side. Ghaṭīkāra said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir, this is the student Jotipāla, my dear friend. Please give him the going forth.’ And Jotipāla the student received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.\r\n\r\nNot long after Jotipāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha Kassapa—having stayed in Vebhaliṅga as long as he pleased—set out for Varanasi. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Varanasi, where he stayed near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. King Kikī of Kāsi heard that he had arrived. He had the finest carriages harnessed. He then mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Varanasi to see the Buddha Kassapa. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha Kassapa on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk.\r\n\r\nThen King Kikī said to the Buddha, ‘Sir, would the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?’ The Buddha Kassapa consented with silence.\r\n\r\nThen, knowing that the Buddha had consented, King Kikī got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. And when the night had passed, King Kikī had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home—soft saffron rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, ‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’\r\n\r\nThen Kassapa Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of King Kikī, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Then King Kikī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods.\r\n\r\nWhen the Buddha Kassapa had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, King Kikī took a low seat and sat to one side. There he said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir, may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Varanasi for the rainy season. The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style.’\r\n\r\n‘Enough, great king. I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence.’\r\n\r\nFor a second time … and a third time King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir, may the Buddha please accept my invitation to reside in Varanasi for the rainy season. The Saṅgha will be looked after in the same style.’\r\n\r\n‘Enough, Great King. I have already accepted an invitation for the rains residence.’\r\n\r\nThen King Kikī, thinking, ‘The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Varanasi,’ became sad and upset. Then King Kikī said to the Buddha Kassapa, ‘Sir, do you have another supporter better than me?’\r\n\r\n‘Great king, there is a market town named Vebhaliṅga, where there is a potter named Ghaṭīkāra. He is my chief supporter. Now, great king, when you thought, “The Buddha does not accept my invitation to reside for the rains in Varanasi,” you became sad and upset. But Ghaṭīkāra doesn’t get upset, nor will he.\r\n\r\nGhaṭīkāra has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. He doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. He has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethics loved by the noble ones. He is free of doubt regarding suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. He eats in one part of the day; he’s celibate, ethical, and of good character. He has set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and currency. He has put down the shovel and doesn’t dig the earth with his own hands. He takes what has crumbled off by a riverbank or been dug up by mice, and brings it back in a carrier. When he has made a pot, he says, “Anyone may leave bagged sesame, mung beans, or chickpeas here and take what they wish.” He provided for his blind old parents. And since he has ended the five lower fetters, Ghaṭīkāra will be reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.\r\n\r\nThis one time, great king, I was staying near the market town of Vebhaliṅga. Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where I said to them, “Excuse me, where has Bhaggava gone?”\r\n\r\n“Your supporter has gone out, sir. But take rice from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.” So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said, “Who took rice from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”\r\n\r\n“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra thought, “I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, in that the Buddha Kassapa trusts me so much!” Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.\r\n\r\nAnother time, great king, I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga. Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, went to the home of Ghaṭīkāra’s parents, where I said to them, “Excuse me, where has Bhaggava gone?”\r\n\r\n“Your supporter has gone out, sir. But take porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan and eat.” So that’s what I did. And after eating I got up from my seat and left.\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said, “Who took porridge from the pot and sauce from the pan, ate it, and left?”\r\n\r\n“It was the Buddha Kassapa, my dear.”\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra thought, “I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!” Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.\r\n\r\nAnother time, great king, I was staying near that same market town of Vebhaliṅga. Now at that time my hut leaked. So I addressed the mendicants,\r\n\r\n“Mendicants, go to Ghaṭīkāra’s home and find some grass.”\r\n\r\nWhen I said this, those mendicants said to me, “Sir, there’s no grass there, but his workshop has a grass roof.”\r\n\r\n“Then go to the workshop and strip the grass.” So that’s what they did.\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra’s parents said to those mendicants, “Who’s stripping the grass from the workshop?”\r\n\r\n“It’s the mendicants, sister. The Buddha’s hut is leaking.”\r\n\r\n“Take it, sirs! Take it, dearest ones!”\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra went up to his parents and said, “Who stripped the grass from the workshop?”\r\n\r\n“It was the mendicants, dear. It seems the Buddha’s hut is leaking.”\r\n\r\nThen Ghaṭīkāra thought, “I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate, to be trusted so much by the Buddha Kassapa!” Then joy and happiness did not leave him for a fortnight, or his parents for a week.\r\n\r\nThen the workshop remained with the atmosphere for a roof for the whole three months, but the heavens did not rain on it. And that, great king, is what Ghaṭīkāra the potter is like.’\r\n\r\n‘Ghaṭīkāra the potter is fortunate, very fortunate, to be so trusted by the Buddha Kassapa.’\r\n\r\nThen King Kikī sent around five hundred cartloads of rice, soft saffron rice, and suitable sauce to Ghaṭīkāra. Then one of the king’s men approached Ghaṭīkāra and said, ‘Sir, these five hundred cartloads of rice, soft saffron rice, and suitable sauce have been sent to you by King Kikī of Kāsi. Please accept them.’\r\n\r\n‘The king has many duties, and much to do. I have enough. Let this be for the king himself.’\r\n\r\nĀnanda, you might think: ‘Surely the student Jotipāla must have been someone else at that time?’ But you should not see it like this. I myself was the student Jotipāla at that time.”\r\n\r\nThat is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said.

This challenge draws inspiration from Buddhist cosmology, psychohistory, and the themes of societal balance and individual freedom.\r\n\r\n**1. World-Building**:\r\n\r\nImagine a future society where Buddhist cosmology is the foundation for psychohistorical modeling. This society spans across the _31 planes of existence_ described in Buddhist texts, from the formless realms of pure consciousness to the human and animal realms.\r\n\r\n- Describe this multi-realm society, its governance structures, and the interactions between beings in different planes.\r\n- Include technological, philosophical, and cultural elements that emerge from integrating psychohistory with the concept of _kamma_ (karma) and _samsara_ (cycle of rebirth).\r\n- Address how the society handles ethical dilemmas involving beings of vastly different capabilities and lifespans.\r\n\r\n**2. Reasoning**:\r\n\r\nDevelop a framework for using psychohistorical modeling in this multi-realm society. Address:\r\n\r\n- How psychohistory adapts to the varying laws of causality and time across the 31 planes.\r\n- The role of _kamma_ as a probabilistic input in psychohistorical calculations.\r\n- Ethical considerations of influencing karmic trajectories to steer societal outcomes, balancing collective well-being and individual liberation.\r\n\r\n**3. Creative Writing**:\r\n\r\nWrite a story (700–1,000 words) set in this multi-realm society. Include:\r\n\r\n- A protagonist who uncovers a disruption in the psychohistorical model—a karmic anomaly that threatens the balance across realms.\r\n- A dramatic confrontation between the protagonist and a faction that seeks to exploit the anomaly for personal gain.\r\n- Themes of impermanence, interdependence, and the struggle between determinism (psychohistory) and liberation (_nibbana_).\r\n- Vivid depictions of how beings from different planes interact and perceive reality.\r\n\r\n**4. Programming**:\r\n\r\nCreate a HTML/CSS/JS/CanvasAPI program that simulates a simplified version of psychohistorical modeling for this society. The program should:\r\n\r\n- Model populations in multiple planes of existence, each with unique parameters (e.g., lifespan, karmic weight, inter-realm interactions).\r\n- Integrate _kamma_ as a probabilistic factor influencing societal trends across realms.\r\n- Allow the user to introduce anomalies (e.g., sudden karmic imbalances or external influences) and observe the ripple effects.\r\n- Visualize the system's evolution over simulated cycles of rebirth, showing shifts in population and karmic balance across realms.\r\n- ALL the code MUST be put into a SINGLE file.\r\n\r\n5. Additional Instructions:\r\n\r\n- Ensure all components are tightly integrated. The world-building should inform the reasoning, which shapes the story, and the program should simulate the principles and dynamics described.\r\n- Use Buddhist philosophical concepts like _anicca_ (impermanence), _dukkha_ (suffering), and _anatta_ (non-self) as thematic undercurrents.\r\n- The response should explore the interplay between cosmic order (psychohistory) and the individual's path to liberation.\r\n\r\nGood luck balancing the scales of karma and cosmic prediction!","solution":"","profile":"worldbuilding"},{"text":"Translate the below text to idiomatic casual spoken Vietnamese.

At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!”\r\n\r\n“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:\r\n\r\n“Mendicants, I will teach you the explanation of the restraint of all defilements. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:\r\n\r\n“Mendicants, I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see. For one who knows and sees what? Rational application of mind and irrational application of mind. When you apply the mind irrationally, defilements arise, and once arisen they grow. When you apply the mind rationally, defilements don’t arise, and those that have already arisen are given up.\r\n\r\nSome defilements should be given up by seeing, some by restraint, some by using, some by enduring, some by avoiding, some by dispelling, and some by developing.\r\n\r\n1. Defilements Given Up by Seeing\r\n\r\nAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by seeing? Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. They don’t understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind. So they apply the mind to things they shouldn’t and don’t apply the mind to things they should.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the things to which they apply the mind but should not? They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. These are the things to which they apply the mind but should not.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the things to which they do not apply the mind but should? They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements: the defilements of sensual desire, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. These are the things to which they do not apply the mind but should.\r\n\r\nBecause of applying the mind to what they should not and not applying the mind to what they should, unarisen defilements arise and arisen defilements grow.\r\n\r\nThis is how they apply the mind irrationally: ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past? Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’ Or they are undecided about the present thus: ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’\r\n\r\nWhen they apply the mind irrationally in this way, one of the following six views arises in them and is taken as a genuine fact. The view: ‘My self survives.’ The view: ‘My self does not survive.’ The view: ‘I perceive the self with the self.’ The view: ‘I perceive what is not-self with the self.’ The view: ‘I perceive the self with what is not-self.’ Or they have such a view: ‘This self of mine is he, the speaker, the knower who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms. This self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable, and will last forever and ever.’ This is called a misconception, the thicket of views, the desert of views, the twist of views, the dodge of views, the fetter of views. An unlearned ordinary person who is fettered by views is not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not freed from suffering, I say.\r\n\r\nBut take a learned noble disciple who has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons. They understand to which things they should apply the mind and to which things they should not apply the mind. So they apply the mind to things they should and don’t apply the mind to things they shouldn’t.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the things to which they don’t apply the mind and should not? They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, give rise to unarisen defilements and make arisen defilements grow: the defilements of sensual desire, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. These are the things to which they don’t apply the mind and should not.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the things to which they do apply the mind and should? They are the things that, when the mind is applied to them, do not give rise to unarisen defilements and give up arisen defilements: the defilements of sensual desire, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. These are the things to which they do apply the mind and should.\r\n\r\nBecause of not applying the mind to what they should not and applying the mind to what they should, unarisen defilements don’t arise and arisen defilements are given up.\r\n\r\nThey rationally apply the mind: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. And as they do so, they give up three fetters: substantialist view, doubt, and misapprehension of precepts and observances. These are called the defilements that should be given up by seeing.\r\n\r\n2. Defilements Given Up by Restraint\r\n\r\nAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, lives restraining the faculty of the eye. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint. Reflecting rationally, they live restraining the faculty of the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint.\r\n\r\nFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint do not arise when there is such restraint. These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint.\r\n\r\n3. Defilements Given Up by Using\r\n\r\nAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by using? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, makes use of robes: ‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’\r\n\r\nReflecting rationally, they make use of almsfood: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will have the means to keep going, blamelessness, and a comfortable abiding.’\r\n\r\nReflecting rationally, they make use of lodgings: ‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’\r\n\r\nReflecting rationally, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick: ‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’\r\n\r\nFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used. These are called the defilements that should be given up by using.\r\n\r\n4. Defilements Given Up by Enduring\r\n\r\nAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening.\r\n\r\nFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are endured. These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring.\r\n\r\n5. Defilements Given Up by Avoiding\r\n\r\nAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer. Reflecting rationally, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting.\r\n\r\nFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided. These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding.\r\n\r\n6. Defilements Given Up by Dispelling\r\n\r\nAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by dispelling? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and obliterates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them.\r\n\r\nFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without dispelling these things do not arise when they are dispelled. These are called the defilements that should be given up by dispelling.\r\n\r\n7. Defilements Given Up by Developing\r\n\r\nAnd what are the defilements that should be given up by developing? It’s when a mendicant, reflecting rationally, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.\r\n\r\nFor the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed. These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing.\r\n\r\nNow, take a mendicant who, by seeing, has given up the defilements that should be given up by seeing. By restraint, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint. By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using. By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring. By avoiding, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. By dispelling, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by dispelling. By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing. They’re called a mendicant who lives having restrained all defilements, who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.”\r\n\r\nThat is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. ","solution":"TBD","profile":"translation"}]
