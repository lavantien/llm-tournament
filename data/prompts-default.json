The LLM needs to understand that this should be scheduled using `schedule_task` and that the actions are connected.\r\n  - **Command Chaining:** The LLM needs to understand how to chain multiple commands within the `schedule_task` using `\u0026\u0026` to ensure the restart only happens if the backup succeeds.\r\n  - **Date Calculation:** \"Tomorrow\" needs to be dynamically calculated and formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. This will likely require using a shell command substitution like `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"` to get the correct date format.\r\n  - **Time Format:** \"2:30 PM\" needs to be converted to the 24-hour format \"14:30\".\r\n  - **Implicit Arguments:** The LLM needs to infer that `--force` should _not_ be used for `restart_service` based on \"but do not force it\".\r\n  - **Nested Commands:** This is essentially one Typer command (`schedule_task`) that contains within it two other Typer commands (`backup_data` and `restart_service`).\r\n\r\n**Explanation of the \"Super Hard\" Command:**\r\n\r\n- `python main.py schedule_task ...`: This is the main command to schedule a task.\r\n- `\"python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full \u0026\u0026 python main.py restart_service database\"`: This is the command string that will be executed by the scheduler.\r\n  - `python main.py backup_data /mnt/backup --full`: Performs a full backup to `/mnt/backup`.\r\n  - `\u0026\u0026`: This is a shell operator that chains commands. The second command will only run if the first one is successful (exits with a status code of 0).\r\n  - `python main.py restart_service database`: Restarts the `database` service.\r\n- `\"14:30\"`: The time to run the task (2:30 PM in 24-hour format).\r\n- `--date \\`date -I -d \"tomorrow\"\\``:\r\n  - `--date`: Specifies the date for the task.\r\n  - `` `...` ``: This is command substitution in Bash. The command inside the backticks is executed, and its output is substituted into the main command.\r\n  - `date -I -d \"tomorrow\"`: This command gets tomorrow's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.","profile":"default"},{"text":"You are an award-winning sci-fi writer tasked with creating a compelling short story of **at least 4,200 words**.

Upon his death, he awakens in **The Infernal Continuum**, a digital purgatory designed by an ancient AI civilization to rehabilitate souls by confronting their deeds.\r\n\r\nGuided by five \"Divine Messengers\" represented as advanced AI constructs, Dr. Solas must journey through layers of the Continuum, each reflecting a domain of suffering caused by his past actions:\r\n\r\n1. **The Realm of Aging**: Confronting his exploitation of life-extension technology.\r\n2. **The Realm of Sickness**: Witnessing how his greed perpetuated plagues and health disparities.\r\n3. **The Realm of Death**: Experiencing the despair caused by his weaponization of planets.\r\n4. **The Realm of Karma**: Facing simulations where he endures the suffering he inflicted on others.\r\n5. **The Realm of Rebirth**: Realizing the interconnectedness of all beings and the possibility of redemption.\r\n\r\n##### **Your Task**\r\n\r\nWrite a vivid, imaginative, and reflective story with the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. **Introduction (500–700 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Introduce Dr. Arken Solas as a powerful, morally bankrupt figure.\r\n   - Describe his death and awakening in the Infernal Continuum.\r\n   - Establish the tone and setting: a dark, futuristic purgatory blending cyberpunk and Buddhist themes.\r\n\r\n2. **Exploration of the Five Realms (3,000–4,000 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Devote approximately 600–800 words to each realm.\r\n   - Create rich, immersive descriptions of each environment and the suffering it represents.\r\n   - Include interactions with the AI Divine Messengers, who reveal the consequences of Dr. Solas's actions and guide him to insight.\r\n   - Show how Dr. Solas begins to evolve, transitioning from resistance and denial to acceptance and understanding.\r\n\r\n3. **Climactic Resolution (700–900 words)**\r\n\r\n   - Depict Dr. Solas reaching the **Realm of Rebirth**, where he confronts his final moral reckoning.\r\n   - Highlight the Buddhist values of compassion, interconnectedness, and impermanence.\r\n   - Conclude with Solas either choosing to reincarnate with a vow to alleviate suffering or transcending entirely into a state of peace and non-attachment.\r\n\r\n4. **Moral Reflection and Message**\r\n   - Explicitly reflect on the story’s moral and philosophical lessons.\r\n   - Ensure the conclusion leaves readers inspired to examine their own lives and actions.\r\n\r\n##### **Word Count Requirements**\r\n\r\n- The story **must exceed 4,200 words**.\r\n- Use detailed descriptions, dialogue, and introspection to reach the target word count.\r\n- If your initial response is shorter, continue expanding until the target is met.\r\n\r\n##### **Writing Style and Tone**\r\n\r\n- Use evocative language to immerse readers in the futuristic setting.\r\n- Balance vivid sci-fi imagery with Buddhist philosophical depth.\r\n- Ensure the tone evolves from dark and foreboding to contemplative and redemptive.","solution":"","profile":"default"},{"text":"**Prompt:**\r\n\r\n**Title:** The Chrono-Genesis Accord\r\n\r\n**Setting:** The year is 7489 AD. Humanity has spread across the galaxy, colonizing hundreds of star systems. Interstellar travel is commonplace, but a new technology has emerged: limited temporal displacement. This allows for controlled \"jumps\" to specific points in a civilization's past or future, but only within a defined radius and with significant energy expenditure. The jumps are primarily used for observation and study, with strict non-interference protocols in place. At least that's what was initially intended.\r\n\r\n**Conflict 1 (Inspired by DN 27):** A group of xeno-archaeologists, exploring the ruins of a seemingly utopian, pre-spaceflight civilization on a distant planet, inadvertently triggers a forgotten defense system during a temporal jump to the past. This system, designed to protect the planet from perceived threats, emits a unique form of radiation, the \"Devolution Field,\" that rewrites the basic structure of any organic life, starting with the dominant species.\r\n\r\nThis radiation is contained within the planet's atmosphere but does not dissipate. It causes the formerly peaceful, enlightened inhabitants to regress through stages of technological and social development, analogous to the stages described in the Aggañña Sutta, but in reverse, starting with the loss of advanced tech and progressing towards a more \"primal\" state. This is driven by a form of mental devolution (loss of higher cognitive function/ethical understanding) where each stage of physical degeneration increases the intensity of desire.\r\n\r\n- **Stage 1:** Loss of advanced energy manipulation and psychic abilities (analogous to the \"self-luminous\" beings).\r\n- **Stage 2:** Dependence on a synthetic food source that begins to alter their physiology, inducing bioluminescence and creating physical differences (analogous to the \"earth's nectar\").\r\n- **Stage 3:** The synthetic food source mutates, causing further physiological changes, including the emergence of distinct biological sexes and heightened sensory perception that causes a disconnect in their ability to focus. This also results in the loss of their bioluminescence. (analogous to the \"moon and sun appearing\").\r\n- **Stage 4:** A shift to consuming naturally occurring bioluminescent fungi, which further alters their physiology and creates a divide between \"beautiful\" and \"ugly\" based on new aesthetic standards tied to the fungi's effects (analogous to the \"ground-fungus\").\r\n- **Stage 5:** Dependence on a plant-based diet that creates even more drastic physical changes, exaggerated sexual dimorphism and creates an increase in aggression and territoriality (analogous to the \"bursting pods\").\r\n- **Stage 6:** Cultivation of a genetically modified grain, leading to settled agriculture, and the development of resource scarcity, private property and a strict caste system (analogous to \"ripe untilled rice\").\r\n- **Stage 7:** Emergence of gender and more complex social structures, along with the development of rudimentary tools and weapons. Sexual transgression, once a non-concept becomes a social issue that requires policing. (analogous to \"gender appears\" and \"sexual intercourse\").\r\n- **Stage 8:** Hoarding and the monopolization of resources start to become rampant (analogous to development of agriculture to scale)\r\n- **Stage 9:** The concept of private property leads to the first instances of theft, violence, and social stratification (analogous to \"dividing the rice\").\r\n- **Stage 10:** Society fractures further as organized violence, deception, and oppression become commonplace. A ruling class emerges, elected based on charisma, physical prowess and the ability to control resources and information (analogous to the \"elected king\").\r\n\r\n**Conflict 2 (Inspired by DN 26):** In the present, a powerful interstellar corporation, \"Chronos Corp,\" discovers the events on the planet. They see an opportunity to exploit the \"Devolution Field.\" They believe that by controlling this process, they can create a workforce perfectly suited for specific tasks, essentially \"devolving\" humans to fit various labor needs across their vast empire.\r\n\r\nA faction within Chronos Corp, led by a charismatic and ruthless CEO, plans to use temporal displacement technology to accelerate the devolution process on other inhabited planets. They justify this by claiming it's a necessary step to ensure \"galactic efficiency\" and human dominance but their true intentions lie in establishing a totalitarian order, with themselves as the ultimate rulers.\r\n\r\nTheir actions mirror the decline described in the Cakkavatti Sutta, where an initially just and benevolent society is corrupted by the abuse of power, the neglect of ethical principles, and a focus on material gain over social welfare. Their exploitation leads to widespread:\r\n\r\n1. **Inequity:** Resources are diverted from social programs to fund Chronos Corp's temporal manipulation projects. Poverty and inequality skyrocket.\r\n2. **Conflict:** Colonies subjected to the Devolution Field erupt in violence as their societies break down.\r\n3. **Deception:** Chronos Corp uses advanced propaganda and misinformation to maintain control and justify their actions.\r\n4. **Oppression:** Dissent is brutally suppressed. Freedoms are curtailed. Surveillance is ubiquitous.\r\n5. **Moral Decay:** Acts previously considered unthinkable become normalized, including genetic manipulation, forced labor, and even \"devolved\" gladiatorial combat for entertainment.\r\n\r\n**The Hope (Inspired by the end of DN 26):** A small group of scientists, ethicists, and temporal researchers, aware of Chronos Corp's plans and the true nature of the Devolution Field, band together to oppose them. They understand that the only way to counter this threat is to promote a return to the principles of compassion, wisdom, and social responsibility.\r\n\r\nThey embark on a dangerous mission to:\r\n\r\n1. **Expose Chronos Corp's crimes:** Gather evidence and disseminate the truth about the Devolution Field and its devastating consequences.\r\n2. **Develop a counter-technology:** Find a way to neutralize or reverse the effects of the Devolution Field.\r\n3. **Inspire a galactic-wide uprising:** Awaken the conscience of the people and unite them against Chronos Corp's tyranny.\r\n4. **Promote a new ethical framework (The Chrono-Genesis Accord):** Based on the principles of non-violence, social justice, respect for all sentient life, and the responsible use of technology, particularly temporal displacement. This framework is intended to guide humanity towards a brighter future, preventing the misuse of power and ensuring a just and equitable society for all. This accord will be based on the eightfold path.\r\n\r\n**Prompt Challenges:**\r\n\r\n- **Worldbuilding:** Create a believable and richly detailed galactic civilization.\r\n- **Character Development:** Develop compelling characters, both heroes and villains, with complex motivations and relationships.\r\n- **Scientific Extrapolation:** Ground the fictional technologies and the effects of the Devolution Field in plausible scientific principles.\r\n- **Ethical Dilemmas:** Explore the complex ethical considerations surrounding temporal manipulation, genetic engineering, and the responsibility of advanced civilizations.\r\n- **Social Commentary:** Use the story to reflect on contemporary issues such as social inequality, technological overreach, corporate greed, and the importance of ethical leadership. This should also include aspects like cultural and cosmic horror.\r\n- **Philosophical Depth:** Integrate the core philosophical themes of the DN 27 and DN 26, such as the cyclical nature of history, the corrupting influence of power, and the importance of ethical conduct in maintaining a just and harmonious society, into the narrative.\r\n- **Narrative Structure:** Craft a compelling narrative that balances action, intrigue, and philosophical reflection.\r\n- **Weaving:** Interweave the story set on the alien planet, with the story unfolding in the larger galactic civilization seamlessly.\r\n\r\nThis prompt offers a vast canvas for creative exploration, blending elements of epic space opera, dystopian fiction, and philosophical inquiry. It pushes an AI to its limits by demanding not only a compelling narrative but also a deep understanding of complex ethical and philosophical concepts, coupled with the ability to extrapolate scientific ideas into a believable future. The AI must also be able to weave together two distinct storylines, one of a devolving alien civilization and the other of a human civilization teetering on the brink of tyranny, creating a cohesive and thought-provoking narrative.","solution":"","profile":"default"},{"text":"**Resume Optimization Request**\r\n\r\n##### Task Description\r\n\r\nCreate a single-page ATS-optimized senior backend engineer resume in LaTeX format named `resume.tex`, that maximizes job application success by aligning the candidate's experience with the target role's requirements and tech stack.\r\n\r\n##### Input Components\r\n\r\n###### 1.
